            <h1>How solar energy is used to generate heat</h1>
            <p>Heliosystems are used for water heating and home heating. They can provide heat (at the owner's request) even when the heating season is over and provide the house with hot water for free. The simplest device is metal panels that are installed on the roof of the house. They store energy and warm the water that circulates through the pipes hidden underneath them. The functioning of all solar systems is based on this principle, even though they may differ structurally.
                <br><br>
                Solar collectors consist of:
                accumulator tank, pumping station, controller, pipelines, fittings
                <br><br>
                According to the type of construction, flat and vacuum collectors are distinguished. In the former, the bottom is covered with thermal insulation material, and the liquid circulates through glass pipes. Vacuum collectors are very efficient, because heat losses in them are minimized. This type of collector provides not only heating with solar panels of a private house - it is convenient to use it for hot water supply systems and heating of swimming pools.
