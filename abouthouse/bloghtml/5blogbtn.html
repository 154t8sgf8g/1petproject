            <h1>Kit cost and main technical characteristics, payback period</h1>
            <p>Prices for ready-made kits mainly range from 30,000 to 2,000,000 rubles. They depend on the devices that make them up (the type of batteries, number of devices, manufacturer and characteristics). You can meet budget options costing from 10,500 rubles. The economy set includes a panel, charge controller, connector.
                <br><br>
                Standard sets include:
                
                energy module, controller, charge controller, charge battery, inverter, rack, cable, terminals
                <br><br>
                Technical specifications are specified in the application manual:

                Power output and panel size. The more wattage needed, the more favorable it is to buy larger sized batteries.
                <br><br>
                Energy efficiency of the system.
                The temperature coefficient shows how much temperature affects power, voltage and current.
