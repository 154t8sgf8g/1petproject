            <h1>Where solar panels are most often used?</h1>
            <p class="left">The scope of application of solar panels is huge. Even now they are successfully used for power supply of private and apartment houses, farms, including for lighting and heating of greenhouses, buildings, lighting of the adjacent territory, power supply of appliances. <br>
                Most often autonomous power supply is considered in the following cases: <br>
                If the area is not electrified, solar panels for a private house will cost much cheaper than using liquid-fuel generators. <br>
                In rural areas, power outages are not uncommon, and people are literally left without light. By turning on the autonomous power supply, you can live in the usual comfort for a long time, especially since the solar panels always come with a battery. <br>
                In apartment buildings, solar modules are also used as backup, and there are also projects that provide for the use of solar energy for hot water supply.</p>
