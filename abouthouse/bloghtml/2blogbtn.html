            <h1>Life span of solar panels</h1>
            <p>As a rule, in the documents on the equipment, a shelf life of 20 to 25 or even 30 years is indicated. However, many devices continue to function even after the period specified by manufacturers. For example, the world's first solar battery has been in operation for over 60 years, and over the years the production technology has been significantly improved. By following simple recommendations, the service life of solar panels can be extended:
                <br><br>
                Prevent physical damage, such as falling trees, tearing by wind and scratches on sensitive elements. The efficiency of the device depends on the latter.
                Perform regular maintenance: servicing and cleaning.
                If necessary, install wind barrier structures.
                
                Solar panels for private homes (ready-made kits) in the system include the following components: batteries and power electronics. The service life of the first devices is from 2 to 15 years, the second - from 5 to 20 years, depending on the characteristics, intensity of use and careful care.</p>
