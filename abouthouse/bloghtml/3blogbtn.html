            <h1>General characteristics and availability for purchase</h1>
            <p>The equipment is environmentally friendly and provides stable power without power surges. And, most importantly, it supplies free energy: for which there are no utility bills. A solar module converts light into electrical energy by generating a direct current. The area of the panels can reach several meters. When the capacity of the system needs to be increased, the number of modules is increased. Their efficiency depends on the intensity of sunlight and the angle of incidence of rays: on location, season, climatic conditions and time of day. To competently take into account all these nuances, installation should be performed by professionals.
                <br><br>
                Types of modules: <br>Monocrystalline.
                Consists of silicone cells that convert solar energy. They are distinguished by their compact size. In terms of performance, this is until recently the most efficient (efficiency up to 22%) solar panel for the house. The set (its price is one of the most expensive) will cost from 100 thousand rubles.
                <br><br>
                Polycrystalline.
                They use polycrystalline silicon. They are not as effective (efficiency up to 18%) as monocrystalline photocells. But their cost is significantly lower, so they are available to a wide population.
                <br><br>
                Amorphous.
                They have thin-film photovoltaic cells based on silicon. They are inferior to mono and polycrystals in energy production, but they are cheaper. Their advantage is the ability to function in diffuse and even low light.
                <br><br>
                Heterostructured.
                Modern and the most efficient solar modules to date, with an efficiency of 22-25% (over the entire lifetime!). They work effectively both in cloudy weather and at high temperatures.
                <br><br>
                In Russia, the only manufacturer of modules using this technology is Hevel, which is among the top five global manufacturers of heterostructured solar modules. The system also includes the following components:
<br>
                An inverter that converts direct current to alternating current.
                A rechargeable battery. It not only stores energy, but also levels out voltage fluctuations when the light level changes.
                Controller of the battery charging voltage, charging mode, temperature and other parameters.
                In stores you can buy both individual components and entire systems. At the same time, the power of the devices is determined based on specific needs.</p>
