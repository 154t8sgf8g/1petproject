            <h1>Functioning, types of inverters and their comparative energy efficiency</h1>
            <p>Converters or inverters are key components of solar panels. They transform the direct current produced by the module into alternating voltage of 220 V, which is necessary for the operation of electrical appliances. Inverters have a capacity from 250 to 8000 watts. When buying it is recommended to take into account the highest load on the network and correlate voltage and power. Optimal parameters are considered to be: 12 volts and 600 watts, 24 volts at 600-1500 watts, 48 volts if the power is more than 1500 watts.
                Varieties of converters
                <br><br>
                Standalone. Before you choose an inverter, you need to determine what devices will be powered from it, and calculate their total maximum power per unit of time. It is recommended to take the power of the inverter a little more. Some household appliances, when turned on, create a sharp increase in voltage, because of which the device can fail.
                Synchronous. They accumulate energy, and the excess is transferred to the electric grid. In case of a shortage of electricity generated by the system, the converter will "borrow" it from the general network. The use of a synchronous type model will avoid a power outage. <br><br>
                Multifunctional devices have combined the advantages of the first and second type.
                The total cost of solar panels for private homes is also influenced by converters. Depending on the shape of the output voltage signal, there are several types of them, which differ in application and cost:

With a sinusoidal signal. Create a current of high quality, which affects their cost. From them work large household appliances: refrigerators, boilers, air conditioners.
Rectangular. To these inexpensive inverters connect lighting devices. Most home appliances are incompatible with them.
Pseudosinusoidal. Their advantage is the possibility of connecting almost all home appliances. But the quality of the signal is reduced compared to the first type, so they cost less.</p>
